## 1. Understanding LinkedClaims
### What it is
### Why use it
### Core concepts
### Benefits
### Disclaimer
  This guide serves as a practical resource for understanding and implementing LinkedClaims. Drawing from actual implementations in humanitarian aid tracking and community impact verification, we share insights and approaches that have worked in real situations.
While we offer recommendations and best practices, this document is not a technical specification. Users should view these suggestions as starting points rather than strict requirements. Every implementation is unique, and organizations should adapt these practices to their specific needs and circumstances.
We encourage readers to combine these insights with other resources, expert advice, and their own experience to create the most effective solutions for their use cases.
Target Audience 
Developers who intend to implement the LinkedClaims specification, technical community that is committed to building a more decentralized and open web trust


## 2.Technology Comparison
Will show where LinkedClaims fits, help in decision-making, clarifiy unique value proposition and demonstrates key differentiators


## 3.  Real-World Examples
- Humanitarian aid tracking
- Community impact verification
- OpenCreds skills attestations and verifications
