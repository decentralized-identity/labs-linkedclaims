## Abstract

Evaluating the credibiity of digital information about the real world is a difficult problem, one which is not sufficiently addressed by cryptographic signing or blockchain validation.  An open, interoperable, cross-domain web of trust could enable robust credibility assessment; a number of projects pursue this goal.  LinkedClaims is a minimal standard to enable links between independent claims: each claim must be addressable (ie have a URI), must be about an addressable subject, and must be cryptographically signed.  Several desirable features are also identified, such as the ability to make a determinate hash of claim content.  The LinkedClaim pattern already exists in several independent projects and implementations; by defining profiles or mappings for these existing data structures to a LinkedClaim data model, we enable linking them together without requiring changes to their native formats.

This specification defines the fundamental requirements for a claim to be classified as a "linked claim." It introduces the concept of a LinkedClaim profile, outlines how an ecosystem can achieve conformance with the linked claim requirements, and provides guidance on specifying additional requirements through a profile. However, it does not define any specific profile or provide an implementation guide, which are addressed in separate documents.

## Related Work

The LinkedClaims specification is being developed alongside several complementary initiatives:

* [Progressive Trust](TBD) - A framework for building trust through incremental verification and validation of claims
* [digest Multibase Hashlink](TBD) - TBD
* [inbox](TBD) - The use of an ActivityPub compatible inbox for replies to claims

## Status of This Document

Decentralized Web Node is a _DRAFT_ specification under development within the [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation) (DIF). It is an active work item of the [Linked Claim Incubation Lab at DIF](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/labs/blob/main/proposals/linked_claims/001_proposal.md)  It incorporates requirements and learnings from diverse stakeholders across sectors into a shared specification that meets the collective needs of the community.

The specification will be updated to incorporate feedback, from DIF members and the wider community, with a reference implementation being developed that exercises the features and requirements defined here. We encourage reviewers to submit [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/labs-linkedclaims/issues) as the means by which to communicate feedback and contributions.

## Terminology

[[def:DID]]
~ A Decentralized Identifier as defined in https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/

[[def:Linked Claim]]
~ A structured, cryptographically signed document with a URI subject that is itself addressable at a URI, following at least the MUST requirements detailed below.

[[def:Signer]]
~ The entity that cryptographically signs a claim (known as the "issuer" in Verifiable Credentials)

[[def:URI]]
~ a Uniform Resource Identifier as defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986

## Core Pattern

```mermaid

graph LR
    subgraph Claim-B
        B_id["id: URI_B"]
        B_subject["subject: URI_A"]
        B_content["content: {...}"]
        B_sig["signature: xyz"]
    end
    
    subgraph Claim-A
        A_id["id: URI_A"]
        A_subject["subject: URL_X"]
        A_content["content: {...}"]
        A_sig["signature: xyz"]
    end

    subgraph Resource
        X["URL_X"]
    end

    %% Claims point to their subjects
    B_subject -.-> A_id
    A_subject -.-> X
    
    classDef claim fill:#f8f8ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    classDef claimPart fill:#ffffff,stroke:#666,stroke-width:1px
    classDef resource fill:#e8f4f8,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    
    class B_id,B_subject,B_content,B_sig,A_id,A_subject,A_content,A_sig claimPart
    style Claim-A fill:#f8f8ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Claim-B fill:#f8f8ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Resource fill:#e8f4f8,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style X fill:#ffffff
    
    linkStyle 0,1 stroke:#666,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5
```

## LinkedClaim Conformance Requirements

A LinkedClaim:

* **MUST** have a subject that can be any valid [URI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986)
* **MUST** itself have an identifier that is a well-formed URI (URN is acceptable)
* **MUST** be cryptographically signed, such as with a DID
* **SHOULD** provide a mechanism to retrieve deterministic machine-readable content from its URI
* **SHOULD** include a date that is in the signed data
* **SHOULD** contain evidence such as links to a source or attachments, optionally hashlinked
* **SHOULD** have a URI-addressable cryptographic signer
* **MAY** have a narrative statement
* **MAY** have a subject that itself is a claim
* **MAY** be a W3C Verifiable Credential or similar digital credential specification
* **MAY** provide a way for the signer to mutate or revoke the claim
* **MAY** provide an inbox or reply-to address to notify of claims made about this claim
* **MAY** have a separate published date and effective date
* **MAY** be public or access controlled

## Advanced Patterns 

_enabled by implementing the SHOULD recommendations_

### Signer Attestation and Content Integrity Pattern
```mermaid

graph LR
    subgraph Claim-A
        A_id["id: URI_A"]
        A_subject["subject: did:example:456"]
        A_content["content: {...}"]
        A_sig["signature: xyz"]
    end
    
    subgraph Claim-B
        B_id["id: URI_B"]
        B_subject["subject: URI_X"]
        B_content["content: {...}"]
        B_sig["signature: xyz"]
        B_signer["signer: did:example:456"]
        B_evidence["evidence: {
            url: https://example.com/doc,
            hash: abc123
        }"]
    end

    subgraph Evidence
        E["Document"]
    end

    %% Only Claim B points to evidence, A points to B's signer
    A_subject -.-> B_signer
    B_evidence -.-> E
    
    classDef claim fill:#f8f8ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    classDef claimPart fill:#ffffff,stroke:#666,stroke-width:1px
    classDef evidence fill:#f0fff0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    
    class A_id,A_subject,A_content,A_sig,B_id,B_subject,B_content,B_sig,B_signer,B_evidence claimPart
    style Claim-A fill:#f8f8ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Claim-B fill:#f8f8ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Evidence fill:#f0fff0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    
    linkStyle 0,1 stroke:#666,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5
```
### Public evidence supporting a Private Claim

```mermaid

graph LR
    subgraph Private-Wallet
        subgraph Private-Claim
            P_id["id: URI_P"]
            P_subject["subject: URI_X"]
            P_content["content: {...}"]
            P_sig["signature: xyz"]
        end
    end

    subgraph Public-Validations
        subgraph Validation-A
            V1_id["id: URI_V1"]
            V1_subject["subject: URI_P"]
            V1_content["validation data"]
        end
        subgraph Evidence
            E["Public Evidence"]
        end
    end

    %% Links
    V1_subject -.-> P_id
    V1_content -.-> E
    
    classDef claim fill:#f8f8ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    classDef claimPart fill:#ffffff,stroke:#666,stroke-width:1px
    classDef private fill:#fff0f5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    classDef public fill:#f0fff0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    
    class P_id,P_subject,P_content,P_sig,V1_id,V1_subject,V1_content claimPart
    style Private-Wallet fill:#fff0f5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Public-Validations fill:#f0fff0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Private-Claim fill:#f8f8ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Validation-A fill:#f8f8ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Evidence fill:#ffffff,stroke:#666,stroke-width:1px
    
    linkStyle 0,1 stroke:#666,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5
```

## Minimal Example

Fulfills only the MUST requirements.

```
{
  "id": "https://claims.example.com/claim/123",
  "subject": "https://resource.example.com/entity/456",
  "signature": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:abc#key-1",
    "signatureValue": "zQeVbY4oey5q66..."
  }
}
```

## Advanced Example

## Deterministic vs Human-readable content

A tension exists between providing a human-readable URL, and a machine readable and hashable data structure that can be referenced in a way to guarantee content integrity.  Providing two distinct views does not guarantee that the data in the human readable view is the same as the machine readable data.
